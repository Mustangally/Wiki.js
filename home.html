<h3>This is my personal wiki. It is intended to record my project documentation, notes, and guides as I learn new skills and tools.</h3>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Kevin. I am a driven and intrinsically motivated IT Professional with 6+ years of experience in both formal and informal IT fields. During my years in a professional capacity, I have been privileged to study and become proficient with many systems, from the VMware VSphere environment, Enterprise Networking, Fiber Channel Networking, User Administration in both on-prem and hosted environments, Storage &amp; Backup Configuration and Maintenance, Service Desk Ticketing, Remote Troubleshooting, and many others.</p>
<p>Now, I am currently working towards my goal of becoming a DevOps Engineer. I have taken a keen interest in Docker and Kubernetes, but I am also pursing other tools and technologies like Ansible, Jenkins, Python, and others. I have experience deploying and maintaining standalone docker servers and on-prem Kubernetes clusters built with kubeadm and K3S by Suse Rancher, as well as in the cloud using GKE and EKS.</p>
<p>Additionally, I actively maintain a multi-node homelab built on Proxmox VE. This is where I run “production” deployments of different applications (like this wiki!), development &amp; testing environments for learning new skills, as well as a NAS built on a virtualized instance of TrueNAS Scale.</p>
